You can instruct the editor to temporarily render a 3D model anywhere on the map. Its like an extension of your imagination. Once you have properly applied brush settings, hold down **C** while dragging your mouse around the screen.

You can correct any mistakes made while painting tile flags by holding down **space-bar** as you retouch those tiles.
